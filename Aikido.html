	  <p class="special_p">
	  Aikido (合気道 Aikidō?) is a Japanese martial art developed by Morihei 
	  Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and religious 
	  beliefs. Aikido is often translated as "the Way of unifying (with) life 
	  energy"[1] or as "the Way of harmonious spirit." Ueshiba's goal was to 
	  create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while 
	  also protecting their attacker from injury. Aikido is performed by 
	  blending with the motion of the attacker and redirecting the force of the 
	  attack rather than opposing it head-on. This requires very little 
	  physical strength, as the aikidōka (aikido practitioner) "leads" the 
	  attacker's momentum using entering and turning movements. The techniques 
	  are completed with various throws or joint locks.[5]

	 <h2 class="default_h2">Early History of Aikido</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba (植芝 盛平 Ueshiba Morihei, 
	 14 December 1883 – 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido 
	 practitioners as Ōsensei ("Great Teacher").[8] Ueshiba envisioned aikido 
	 not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of
	 his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation. During 
	 Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the Aiki 
	 that Ueshiba studied into a wide variety of expressions by martial artists 
	 throughout the world.

	 <h2 class="default_h2">Aikido in the present and Future</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by Minoru 
	 Mochizuki with a visit to France where he introduced aikido techniques to 
	 judo students.[14] He was followed by Tadashi Abe in 1952 who came as the 
	 official Aikikai Hombu representative, remaining in France for seven 
	 years. Kenji Tomiki toured with a delegation of various martial arts 
	 through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953.[13] Later in 
	 that year, Koichi Tohei was sent by Aikikai Hombu to Hawaii, for a full 
	 year, where he set up several dojo. This was followed up by several 
	 further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the 
	 United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964; and 
	 Germany 1965. Designated "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa" by 
	 Morihei Ueshiba, Masamichi Noro arrived in France in September 1961. 
	 Seiichi Sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. 
	 Today there are aikido dojo available throughout the world. Aikido was 
	 exhibited in Hollywood films by Steven Seagal in the 1990s.
