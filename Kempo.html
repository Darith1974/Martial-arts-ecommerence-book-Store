	otherwise. Wave will generate a error as it is blank but there is explicit heading when one opens this webpage.-->

	  <p class="special_p">
	  Kenpō (拳法?) is the name of several Japanese martial arts. The word 
	  kenpō is a Japanese translation of the Chinese word "quánfǎ. This term is 
	  often informally transliterated as "kempo", as a result of applying 
	  Traditional Hepburn romanization. Kenpō has also been appropriated as a 
	  modern term: a name for multiple martial arts that developed in Hawaii 
	  due to cross-cultural exchange between practitioners of Ryukyuan martial 
	  arts, Chinese martial arts, Japanese martial arts and multiple additional 
	  influences. In the United States, kenpo is often referred to as Kenpo 
	  Karate. The most widespread style, the Tracy System of Kenpo, has it's 
	  origin in the teachings of James Mitose, William Kwai Sun Chow, and 
	  directly through Ed Parker.

	  <h2 class="default_h2">Early History of Kempo</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 The American East Coast features a branch of Kenpo created by Nick Cerio,
	 and later built upon and redefined by Fredrick J. Villari who brought the 
	 hybrid art of Shaolin Kempo Karate to the general public through his 
	 nationwide network of "Villari's Martial Arts Centers". The Villari system 
	 integrated the strengths of American Kenpo with the larger scope of 
	 movement and grappling available in Shaolin Kung Fu and Chin Na to create 
	 a highly unique American Kenpo offshoot system.

	 <h2 class="default_h2">Kempo in the present and Future</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 The Kenpo Karate that was later developed by Ed Parker became the system 
	 of American Kenpo Karate. It employs a blend of Chinese circular movements 
	 and hard linear movements, producing an effective self defense system. 
	 Parker and his students created techniques with names such as Thundering 
	 Hammers, Five Swords, Prance Of The Tiger, and Flashing Mace to provide 
	 memorization tools to the student.
