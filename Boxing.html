	  Boxing, also called pugilism, is a combat sport in which two people engage
	  in a contest using only their fists. There are two forms of boxing: amateur
	  and professional. Amateur boxing is an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is
	  a common fixture in most of the major international games - it also has its
	  own World Championships. Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of
	  between one to three minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided
	  when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue match by a referee or if an
	  opponent is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigning by throwing in a towel,
	  or by judges' scorecards at the end of the bout.
	  </p>	
      	  <p class="special_p">
	  The birth hour of boxing as a sport may be its acceptance by the ancient
	  Greeks as an Olympic game as early as 688 BC. Modern boxing evolved in
	  Europe, particularly Great Britain and Germany. In 2004, ESPN ranked boxing
	  as the most difficult sport in the world.

	 Fist fighting depicted in Sumerian relief carvings from the 3rd millennium BC,
	 while an ancient Egyptian relief from the 2nd millennium BC depicts both
	 fist-fighters and spectators. Both depictions show bare-fisted contests. 
	 Other depictions can be seen in Assyrian, Babylonian and Hittite art. The 
	 earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be found on
	 Minoan Crete (c. 1500–900 BC), and on Sardinia, if we consider the boxing statues 
	 of Prama mountains (c. 2000–1000 BC).

	 In 1867, the Marquess of Queensberry rules were drafted by John Chambers for 
	 amateur championships held at Lillie Bridge in London for Lightweights, Middleweights 
	 and Heavyweights. The rules were published under the patronage of the Marquess of 
	 Queensberry, whose name has always been associated with them. Throughout the 17th 
	 through 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by money, as the fighters 
	 competed for prize money, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet 
	 on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, 
	 nd amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic 
	 and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is 
	 computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, 
	 and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, 
	 and knockouts. Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by 
	 ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype 
	 of an Automated Boxing Scoring System, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves 
	 safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing 
	 remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is 
	 dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, 
	 especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation 
	 for a professional career.
