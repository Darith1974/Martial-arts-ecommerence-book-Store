	  <h2 class="default_h2">TaeKwon do</h2>
	 
	  <p class="special_p">
	  Taekwondo (태권도; 跆拳道; Korean pronunciation: [tʰɛkwʌndo]) is a Korean 
	  martial art and the national sport of South Korea. In Korean, tae (태, 跆) 
	  means "to strike or break with foot"; kwon (권, 拳) means "to strike or 
	  break with fist"; and do (도, 道) means "way", "method", or "path". Thus,
	  taekwondo may be loosely translated as "the way of the hand and the 
	  foot." [1] The name taekwondo is also written as taekwon-do, tae kwon-do, 
	  or tae kwon do by various organizations, based on historical, 
	  philosophical, or political[citation needed] reasons. It combines combat 
	  techniques, self-defense, sport, exercise, and in some cases meditation 
	  and philosophy. In 1989, Taekwondo was the world's most popular martial 
	  art in terms of number of practitioners.[2] Gyeorugi 
	  (pronounced [ɡjʌɾuɡi]), a type of sparring, has been an Olympic event 
	  since 2000.

	 <h2 class="default_h2">Early History of Taekwondo</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 The oldest Korean martial art was an amalgamation of unarmed combat styles 
	 developed by the three rival Korean Kingdoms of Goguryeo, Silla, and 
	 Baekje,[4] where young men were trained in unarmed combat techniques to 
	 develop strength, speed, and survival skills. The most popular of these 
	 techniques was subak, with taekkyeon being the most popular of the 
	 segments of subak. Those who demonstrated strong natural aptitude were 
	 selected as trainees in the new special warrior corps, called the Hwarang. 
	 It was believed that young men with a talent for the liberal arts may have 
	 the grace to become competent warriors. These warriors were instructed in 
	 academics as well as martial arts, learning philosophy, history, a code of 
	 ethics, and equestrian sports. Their military training included an 
	 extensive weapons program involving swordsmanship and archery, both on 
	 horseback and on foot, as well as lessons in military tactics and unarmed 
	 combat using subak. Although subak was a leg-oriented art in Goguryeo, 
	 Silla's influence added hand techniques to the practice of subak.

      During this time a few select Silla warriors were given training in 
     taekkyeon by the early masters from Koguryo. These warriors then became 
     known as the Hwarang. The Hwarang set up a military academy for the sons 
     of royalty in Silla called Hwarang-do, which means "the way of flowering 
     manhood." The Hwarang studied taekkyeon, history, Confucian philosophy, 
     ethics, Buddhist morality, social skills and military tactics. The guiding 
     principles of the Hwarang warriors were based on Won Gwang's five codes of 
     human conduct and included loyalty, filial duty, trustworthiness, valor 
     and justice. Taekkyeon was spread throughout Korea because the Hwarang 
     traveled all around the peninsula to learn about the other regions and 
     people.

	 <h2 class="default_h2">Taekwondo in the present and Future</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 Taekwondo is known for its emphasis on kicking techniques, which 
	 distinguishes it from martial arts such as karate or southern styles of 
	 kung fu. The rationale is that the leg is the longest and strongest weapon 
	 a martial artist has, and kicks thus have the greatest potential to 
	 execute powerful strikes without successful retaliation. Historically, the 
	 Koreans thought that the hands were too valuable to be used in combat.
	 
	 Since taekwondo is developed in several different kwans, there are several 
	 different expressions of taekwondo philosophy. For example, the tenets of 
	 the ITF are said to be summed up by the last two phrases in the ITF 
	 Student Oath: "I shall be a champion of justice and freedom" and "I shall 
	 build a better and peaceful world."
	 Two of the most popular systems of taekwondo are named solely after their 
	 respective organizations: the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) and the 
	 International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF).

	 The WTF was founded in 1973, with roots in the KTA. The KTA Central Dojang 
	 had been opened in South Korea in 1972, and a few months later, the name 
	 was changed to the Kukkiwon. The following year, the WTF was formed. The 
	 International Olympic Committee recognized the WTF and taekwondo sparring 
	 in 1980.
