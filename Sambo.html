	  Sambo (Russian: самбо; САМооборона Без Оружия) is a Russian martial art 
	  and combat sport. The word "SAMBO" is an acronym for SAMooborona Bez 
	  Oruzhiya, which literally translates as "self-defense without weapons". 
	  Sambo is relatively modern since its development began in the early 1920s 
	  by the Soviet Red Army to improve their hand to hand combat abilities. 
	  Intended to be a merger of the most effective techniques of other martial 
	  arts, Sambo has roots in Japanese judo plus traditional folk styles of 
	  wrestling such as: Armenian Kokh, Georgian Chidaoba, Moldavian Trîntǎ, 
	  Tatar Köräş, Uzbek Kurash, Mongolian Khapsagay and Azerbaijani Gulesh. 
	  The pioneers of Sambo were Viktor Spiridonov and Vasili Oshchepkov. 
	  Oshchepkov died in prison as a result of the political purges of 1937 
	  after accusations of being a Japanese spy.

	  <h2 class="default_h2">Early History of Sambo</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 Sambo's early development stemmed from the independent efforts of Vasili 
	 Oschepkov and Victor Spiridonov, to integrate the techniques of judo, 
	 jujitsu, and other foreign martial arts into native wrestling styles. 
	 Oschepkov taught judo and karate to elite Red Army forces at the Central 
	 Red Army House. Vasili Oschepkov was one of the first foreigners to learn 
	 Judo in Japan and had earned his nidan (second degree black belt, out of 
	 then five) from judo's founder, Kano Jigoro. Spiridonov's background 
	 involved indigenous martial arts from various Soviet regions as well as an 
	 interest in Japanese JuJitsu (though he never formally trained it). His 
	 reliance on movement over strength was in part based on the fact that he 
	 received a bayonet wound during World War I which left his left arm lame. 
	 Both Oschepkov and Spiridonov independently hoped that Soviet military 
	 hand-to-hand combat techniques could be improved with an infusion of the 
	 techniques distilled from other foreign martial arts. Contrary to common 
	 lore, Oschepkov and Spiridonov did not cooperate on the development of 
	 their hand-to-hand systems. Rather, their independent notions of 
	 hand-to-hand combat merged through cross-training between students and 
	 formulative efforts by their students and military staff. While Oschepkov 
	 and Spiridonov did have occasion to collaborate, their efforts were not 
	 completely united.

	 <h2 class="default_h2">Sambo in the present and Future</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 In 1968, the FILA accepted Sambo as the third style of international 
	 wrestling. In 1985, the Sambo community formed its own organization, 
	 Federation International Amateur Sambo (FIAS). In 1993, FIAS split into 
	 two organizations, both used the same name and logo and the two groups 
	 were often referred to as FIAS "East" (under Russian control) and FIAS 
	 West" (under US and Western European control). This split mirrored the 
	 last days of Cold War politics of the time as well as the recent break-up 
	 of the Soviet Union. In the U.S., disagreements between the sport's 
	 organizers and the rise of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in the 1990s slowed down 
	 the growth of Sambo before the success of several Sambo fighters increased 
	 its popularity a decade later.[12] In 2005, FILA reached an agreement with 
	 FIAS "West" and re-assumed sanctioning over sport Sambo.[13] However, in 
	 2008, FILA again discontinued sanctioning sambo and sambo is now notably 
	 missing from the FILA website.[14] At present, FIAS sanctions 
	 nternational competition in sport and combat sambo.
