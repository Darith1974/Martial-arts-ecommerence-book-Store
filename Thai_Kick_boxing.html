	 <p class="special_p">
	 Muay Thai (Thai: มวยไทย, RTGS: Muai Thai, IPA: [mūɛj tʰāj]) is a 
	 combat sport from Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various 
	 clinching techniques. It is similar to other Indochinese kickboxing 
	 systems, namely pradal serey from Cambodia, tomoi from Malaysia, lethwei 
	 from Burma and muay Lao from Laos. Descended from muay boran, muay thai 
	 is Thailand's national sport.

	 <h2 class="default_h2">Early History of Thai Kick Boxing</h2>
	 <p class="special_p"> 
	 Various forms of kickboxing have long been practiced throughout Southeast 
	 Asia. Based on Chinese and Indian martial arts,[7] practitioners claim 
	 that these systems can be traced back to a thousand years. Muay thai 
	 evolved from the older muay boran (ancient boxing), an unarmed combat 
	 method which would have been used by Siamese soldiers after losing their 
	 weapons in battle. Some believe that the ancient Siamese military created 
	 muay boran from the weapon-based art, krabi krabong but others contend 
	 that both systems were developed at the same time.[8] Krabi krabong 
	 nevertheless was an important influence on muay thai as seen in the 
	 movements in the wai khru. Muay boran, and therefore muay Thai, was 
	 originally called dhoi muay or simply muay. As well as being a practical 
	 fighting technique for use in actual warfare, muay became a sport in which 
	 the opponents fought in front of spectators who went to watch for 
	 entertainment. 
	 </p>
	 <h2 class="default_h2">Thai Kick Boxing in the present and Future</h2>
	 <p class="special_p">
	 Formal muay thai techniques are divided into two groups: mae mai or major 
	 techniques and luk mai or minor techniques. Muay thai is often a fighting 
	 art of attrition, where opponents exchange blows with one another. This is 
	 certainly the case with traditional stylists in Thailand, but is a less 
	 popular form of fighting in the contemporary world fighting circuit where 
	 the Thai style of exchanging blow for blow is no longer favorable. Almost 
	 all techniques in muay thai use the entire body movement, rotating the hip 
	 with each kick, punch, elbow and block. Muay thai, like boxing and various 
	 forms of kickboxing, is recognized as a very effective striking base 
	 within MMA, and is very widely trained among MMA fighters. Fighters 
	 (some of whom have won titles) such as Anderson Silva, Jon Jones, 
	 Wanderlei Silva, Mauricio Rua, Thiago Silva, Alistair Overeem, Duane 
	 Ludwig, Jose Aldo, Amir Sadollah, Gina Carano, Cristiane Santos employ a 
	 broad range of tactics born of muay thai. Countless other mixed martial 
	 artists have trained in the art, and it is often taught at MMA gyms as is 
	 BJJ and Wrestling. Many techniques associated with muay thai are often 
	 seen in MMA, such as punches, elbows, clinch fighting, leg kicks and knees.
